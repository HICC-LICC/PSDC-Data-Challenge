# PSDC-Data-Challenge

# README for Data Challenge Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to address a data challenge through a combination of data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. It contains Python scripts that utilize various libraries to manipulate and analyze datasets effectively. The notebook is structured into sections, each focused on a specific aspect of the data pipeline, including loading data, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

**Important Note:** The dataset and code in this notebook are sourced from a clone of the Data Science Challenge repository hosted on DevOps. Users must update the repository clone to their own DevOps or Git environment for the notebook to function as expected. See the [Data Sources](#data-sources) section for more details.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **Setup and Initialization**
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Setting global configurations for plots and warnings.

### 2. **Data Loading**
- Loading datasets from the cloned repository into pandas DataFrames.
- Inspecting the initial structure of the data (e.g., `.head()`, `.info()`).

### 3. **Data Cleaning**
- Handling missing values (e.g., filling, dropping).
- Removing duplicates.
- Ensuring consistent data types across columns.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features.

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generating descriptive statistics.
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships using:
  - Histograms.
  - Box plots.
  - Correlation heatmaps.

### 6. **Modeling and Predictions**
- Splitting data into training and testing subsets.
- Applying machine learning algorithms such as linear regression or classification models.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### 7. **Visualization**
- Creating plots to communicate key insights.
- Highlighting patterns and trends in the dataset.
